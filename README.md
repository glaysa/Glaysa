I’m not sure exactly when it began, but for as long as I can remember, I’ve always been—and continue to be—fascinated by technology. The possibilities it offers are truly endless. As someone who once felt uncertain about what I wanted to do with my future, I’m incredibly grateful to have chosen a career in the field of technology. It’s a decision that has brought me both excitement and fulfillment.
